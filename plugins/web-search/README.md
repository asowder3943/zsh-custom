# web-search plugin

This is my overwrite of the ohmyzsh [web-search](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/web-search) plugin

Custom search contexts are:

| Context               | URL                                            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `guser`               | `https://github.com/search?type=users&q=`      |
| `foodlion`            | `https://shop.foodlion.com/search?search_term=`|
